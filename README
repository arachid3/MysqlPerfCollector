This is a MySQL performance_schema monitor to be used by diamond
(http://opensource.brightcove.com/project/diamond/) to collect data for
graphite (http://graphite.readthedocs.org).

At the moment it only collects replication load information, giving you insight
in how loaded your single-threaded mysql replication is.

etsy-snippet.php is a snippet for an etsy-based dashboard that combines the
metrics to a single graph, an example of which is included as well.
